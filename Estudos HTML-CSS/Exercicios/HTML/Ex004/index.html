    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h4>This started out as a simple little thing I was putting together for my own server and friends, and since then it's turned into something pretty ridiculous.  I've gotten some requests about releasing it as a modpack so here it is. <br>
        RLCraft, the RL standing for Real Life or Realism and is a take on another mod I made for Unreal called RLCoop that generally has a similar goal, is my interpretation of what I've always wanted in Minecraft when it comes to pure survival, adventuring and RPG, and immersion.  I hand selected many mods and individually tweaked each and every one to fit the exact play-style I was looking for, making sure they all worked fluidly with each other, adding my own custom scripts for various changes to vanilla behavior, etc. <br>
        Bottom line is, this ain't your dad's Minecraft, and you're going to die...a lot.  Just be prepared for that.  This tends to happen whenever I make mods for any game for some reason...it usually ends up being unfairly difficult.</h4>
